# Welcome to the Momentum Strategy documentation!
This is a Python package developed as part of the PO-245 course project, focusing on the analysis of the momentum strategy within the Brazilian market. Additionally, the package includes an implementation of a variant of this strategy, along with a detailed study in the main.py notebook, available in the associated GitHub directory.

Throughout the development and implementation of the strategy, various resources, including relevant books and scientific papers, were consulted. Furthermore, the valuable input from the course instructors and monitor played a crucial role in refining this approach.

To effectively utilize the momentum package in your simulation, it is crucial to set up everything for the seamless execution of the main function, momentum_simulator. This involves loading a DataFrame in accordance with the format specified in the documentation. Additionally, you will need to provide the desired time frame for the simulation.

The process begins with ensuring that your DataFrame adheres to the prescribed structure detailed in the documentation. This standardized format facilitates the accurate application of the momentum strategy. Once the DataFrame is prepared, you can seamlessly integrate it into the momentum_simulator function, allowing you to simulate the momentum strategy over the specified time period.

By following these steps and leveraging the functionalities provided by the momentum package, you can gain valuable insights into the performance of the momentum strategy tailored to your specific dataset and time frame.

!!! tip
    There is a main notebook in the initial repository that includes an example implementation of the strategy.
